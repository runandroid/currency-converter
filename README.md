Create a script in Python to convert currencies using  an ExchangeRate-API: (https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{base}).

Main Functionalities:

- The user must enter an amount of currency from a given country and specify which currency they want
to convert it to in order to know how much they will have.

- The program must convert the value of the specified currency to the other one using the current exchange rate.
For example, an amount of money in EUROS to US dollars, the program will take the value entered 
and convert it using the current exchange rate between both currencies.

- The API (Application Programming Interface) provides up-to-date exchange rates in JSON format.
  
- The JSON format is used to structure data in text form and enables the exchange of information between applications in a simple, lightweight, and rapid manner.
   
- (API ==> Interface that allows one Software to request data or services from another without needing to know its internal workings).
