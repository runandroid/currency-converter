'''
The program must convert the value of one currency to another using the current exchange rate.
For example, an amount of money in EUROS to US dollars, the program must take the value entered 
and convert it using the current exchange rate between both currencies.

To do this, we must define the value of the currencies. 
For example, you can define the cost of each currency in each country, 
comparing it to 1 US dollar (the de facto currency to this day).

Ultimately, the objective of this program is for the user to enter an amount of currency from 
a given country and specify which currency they want to convert it to in order to know how much they will have.
